I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Chemistry at the 
**University of Chicago**. I work in the lab of Professor **Ben&#238;ot Roux**
as a 
theoretical Chemistry researcher. I work on force field development, with 
special interest in studying ion-protein interactions. 

Broadly, I am interested in applying methodology to biological systems
and materials with emphasis on advancing health and renewable energy
efforts.
I am strongly proficient in the use of most mainstream molecular dynamics 
packages and their associated tools, e.g., NAMD, Charmm, and Amber. 
Additionally, I am proficient in programming with various code, e.g. python, Tcl
, and C++ with an emphasis to scientific computing tasks.
